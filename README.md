## Objectives 
* develop a set of REST APIs capable of reading a JSON file deployed on a server and returning information by using a collection of simple HTTP requests
* build a single HTML (twitterRest.html) web page in which the requests to the APIs will be invoked and the retrieved information will be displayed

## Overview
Companies like Twitter have strong RESTful APIs that allows users to explore the wealth of data they manage and even provide ways to download your entire archive of tweets. Many users rely on Twitter’s favorites as a mechanism to bookmark tweets that link to interesting content elsewhere on the web. However, in order to avoid a potential downfall in the future, where those favorites could one day become unavailable, you've decided to retrieve a list with your favorite tweets as a JSON object. 

## Specification
Your RESTful APIs should be able to respond, with the appropriate data, to the following requests:
* Get all tweets (create time, id, and tweet text) available in the archive.
* Get all known Twitter users included in the archive.
* Get a list of all external links (all links that appear in any field of a tweet. Use
regular expressions) included in the tweets from the archive, the links should be
grouped based on tweet ids.
* Get the details about a given tweet (given the tweet’s id).
* Get detailed profile information about a given Twitter user (given the user’s
screen name).
